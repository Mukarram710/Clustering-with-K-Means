# 📊 K-Means Clustering - Customer Segmentation

Welcome to my unsupervised learning project! In this task, I used **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. The goal was to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior using clustering techniques. 🧠✨

## 🎯 Task Objective

- Perform **K-Means clustering** on a real-world dataset
- Use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Visualize clusters using **PCA** for a 2D view
- Evaluate cluster quality using the **Silhouette Score**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Pandas 📊  
- Matplotlib 🎨  
- NumPy ➗

## 🔍 What I Did

✅ Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
✅ Dropped irrelevant columns like `CustomerID` and `Gender`  
✅ Scaled the data for better clustering results  
✅ Used **Elbow Method** to find the best value of `k`  
✅ Trained a **KMeans** model and predicted clusters  
✅ Visualized the clusters using **PCA (2D projection)**  
✅ Calculated the **Silhouette Score** to evaluate clustering quality
